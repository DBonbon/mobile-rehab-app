# CI/CD Configuration Recap

Great job resolving the frontend testing issues! Here's a comprehensive recap of what we learned and how to move forward with your CI/CD pipeline:

## Frontend Testing Resolution
The key issue we resolved was related to case sensitivity differences between your local Windows environment (case-insensitive) and the GitHub Actions Linux environment (case-sensitive). Specifically:

1. In your repo, Git was tracking the mock directory as `frontend/__mocks__/components/sidebar/` (lowercase)
2. But your imports used `../components/Sidebar/` (uppercase)
3. This worked locally but failed in CI

Our solution:
- [ ] Modified the CI workflow to adjust file paths to match Git's structure
- [ ] Created any missing directories with the correct case
- [ ] Updated import statements to match the actual repository structure

## Git Case-Sensitivity Commands
If you need to change the case of a file or directory in Git, use:
```bash
# For a two-step rename (needed for case changes on Windows)
git mv original_name temp_name
git commit -m "Temporary rename"
git mv temp_name DESIRED_NAME
git commit -m "Rename with correct case"
```

## Backend CI Configuration
Your backend CI workflow is set to only run on the develop branch because of:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]
```

To run it on all branches, change it to:
```yaml
on: [push, pull_request]
```

## Complete CI/CD Structure
Your CI/CD pipeline now consists of:
1. **Frontend CI** (ci-frontend.yml)
   - Runs on all branches
   - Tests React components
   - Builds the frontend
2. **Backend CI** (backend-ci.yml)
   - Currently only runs on develop
   - Tests Django application with coverage
   - Uploads coverage reports

For a complete CI/CD solution, you should:
- [ ] Update backend-ci.yml to run on all branches
- [ ] Create a deployment workflow for your Linode VM when you're ready

## Next Steps
- [ ] **Standardize casing**: Consider adopting consistent naming conventions (all lowercase or camelCase) across your project
- [ ] **Fix test warnings**: Address the prop-type warnings in your tests
- [ ] **Create deployment pipeline**: Set up a workflow that deploys to Linode when tests pass

By keeping a consistent case policy and using these workflows, you should avoid similar issues in the future.
