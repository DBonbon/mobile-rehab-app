# Backend CI/CD Configuration Recap

We've successfully resolved the backend testing issues in the CI/CD pipeline. Here's a detailed breakdown of the problems and solutions:

## Backend Testing Resolution
The primary issues with the backend CI workflow were outdated GitHub Actions, missing spatial database support, and Python version mismatches:

- [ ] Updated deprecated GitHub Actions:
  - Changed `actions/upload-artifact@v3` to `actions/upload-artifact@v4`
  - Updated `actions/checkout@v3` to `actions/checkout@v4`
  - Fixed incorrect action reference where `actions/checkout@v4` was mistakenly replaced

- [ ] Updated Python environment:
  - Changed from Python 3.9 to Python 3.12 to match local development environment
  - Ensured all dependencies are compatible with Python 3.12

- [ ] Configured proper spatial database support:
  - Replaced standard PostgreSQL image with `postgis/postgis:13-3.1`
  - Added required spatial libraries:
    - gdal-bin
    - libgdal-dev
    - python3-gdal
    - binutils
    - libproj-dev
    - libgeos-dev
  - Installed Python GDAL package to match system version

## Backend CI Workflow Configuration
The updated CI workflow now includes:

```yaml
name: Backend CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [ develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ develop ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    services:
      postgres:
        image: postgis/postgis:13-3.1
        env:
          POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgres
          POSTGRES_USER: postgres
          POSTGRES_DB: test_db
        ports:
          - 5432:5432
        options: --health-cmd pg_isready --health-interval 10s --health-timeout 5s --health-retries 5

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - name: Set up Python 3.12
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.12'
    - name: Install system dependencies
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y gdal-bin libgdal-dev python3-gdal binutils libproj-dev libgeos-dev
    # Additional steps...
```

## Current Status
The backend CI workflow now completes successfully with:
- Proper PostGIS spatial database support
- Correct GitHub Actions versions
- Matching Python version between local and CI environments
- Coverage reports properly generated and uploaded

## Recommendations for Backend Testing
- [ ] Consider updating the CI workflow to run on all branches (not just develop)
- [ ] Add database migration checks to ensure schema changes don't break tests
- [ ] Implement parallel test execution to speed up the CI process
- [ ] Set up test fixtures for common data needed across test cases

## References
* GitHub deprecated actions notification: https://github.blog/changelog/2024-04-16-deprecation-notice-v3-of-the-artifact-actions/
* PostGIS Docker images: https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/postgis/postgis/

These changes ensure the backend testing is robust and properly integrated with the CI/CD pipeline.
