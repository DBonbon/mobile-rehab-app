## Description
This issue covers the implementation of frontend linting as part of our CI/CD pipeline, focusing on a phased approach that gives visibility into code quality without blocking deployments.

## Objectives
* Set up ESLint for Next.js/React codebase
* Configure CI pipeline to run linting checks
* Generate linting reports for analysis
* Address critical linting issues

## Implementation Summary

We've implemented a frontend linting solution with the following key features:

- [x] Set up non-blocking linting in CI pipeline (continues on error)
- [x] Configured ESLint to work with our Next.js/React codebase
- [x] Fixed critical global variable redeclaration issues
- [x] Addressed plugin configuration issues

## Technical Implementation

### Completed Tasks

1. **Missing Plugin Configuration**
   - [x] Fixed missing ESLint plugins by properly configuring `.eslintrc.js`
   - [x] Added necessary plugins to the configuration:
     ```javascript
     extends: [
       'eslint:recommended',
       'plugin:react/recommended',
       'plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended'
     ],
     plugins: [
       'react',
       'jsx-a11y'
     ],
     ```

2. **Global Variable Redeclaration Issues**
   - [x] Fixed errors like `'module' is already defined as a built-in global variable`
   - [x] Renamed conflicting variables to avoid global namespace collisions
   - [x] Example fix:
     ```javascript
     // Before
     const module = { exports: {} };
     
     // After
     const myModule = { exports: {} };
     ```

### Remaining Issues to Address

1. **Prop Types Validation**
   - [ ] Add PropTypes to React components
   - [ ] Install prop-types package

2. **Unused Variables**
   - [ ] Clean up unused imports and variables
   - [ ] Use underscore prefix for intentionally unused variables

3. **Console Statements**
   - [ ] Remove or conditionally use console logs
   - [ ] Consider implementing a proper logging utility

4. **Next.js ESLint Integration**
   - [ ] Install Next.js ESLint plugin
   - [ ] Configure for Next.js specific rules

## CI Pipeline Integration

The linting is now part of the CI pipeline but configured to not block deployments:

```yaml
- name: Run ESLint
  run: npm run lint
  continue-on-error: true
  
- name: Upload ESLint Report
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: eslint-report
    path: frontend/eslint-report.html
```

## Next Steps

1. Gradually address remaining linting issues:
   - Start with PropTypes validation
   - Then clean up unused variables
   - Remove console statements last

2. Transition to stricter enforcement:
   - Move from warnings to errors for critical rules
   - Eventually make linting a blocking step in CI

3. Extend linting to include:
   - TypeScript support
   - Code style enforcement
   - Performance and accessibility rules

## Dependencies
* ESLint
* React ESLint plugin
* jsx-a11y plugin
* Next.js ESLint configuration
