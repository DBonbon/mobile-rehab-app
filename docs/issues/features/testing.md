## Description
This subissue focuses on implementing comprehensive testing for both the Wagtail/Django backend and Next.js frontend components as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

## Objectives
* Set up automated testing for the Wagtail/Django backend
* Configure testing for the Next.js frontend
* Implement linting for both components
* Ensure all tests run successfully in CI environment

## Implementation Plan

### Backend Testing (Wagtail/Django)
- [ ] Configure Django test runner in CI environment
- [ ] Set up pytest configuration for the project
- [ ] Implement unit tests for critical models and views
- [ ] Configure code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up Django linting with pylint/flake8
- [ ] Create fixtures for test data

### Frontend Testing (Next.js)
- [ ] Configure Jest for component testing
- [ ] Resolve Next.js router mocking issues
- [ ] Set up React Testing Library
- [ ] Configure ESLint for code quality
- [ ] Implement critical component tests
- [ ] Set up GitHub action to run `npm test:ci`

### CI Integration
- [ ] Configure test results reporting
- [ ] Set up failure notifications
- [ ] Implement test caching for faster CI runs
- [ ] Configure parallel test execution
- [ ] Add status badges to README

## Technical Considerations
* Test database configuration needs to be isolated from production
* Frontend tests will need to mock API responses
* Need to handle Next.js router in test environment
* Consider using Docker for consistent test environments
* Balance between test coverage and CI execution time

## Expected Outcome
A fully automated testing pipeline for both backend and frontend that:
1. Runs on every pull request
2. Provides clear pass/fail results
3. Catches regressions before they're merged
4. Maintains code quality through linting

## Dependencies
* Django/Wagtail test framework
* Jest and React Testing Library
* GitHub Actions configuration
* Access to test environment
