# Feature: Standardized Frontend Testing Infrastructure

## Session Info
Related PRs: N/A
Epic: #[epic-number]
Issue Type: Enhancement

## Context
We currently have inconsistent testing patterns across our frontend components. Some components pass tests (like PageTitle) while others (like dynamic components that require data fetching) fail in CI environments. We need a standardized approach to testing that works for all component types.

Current insights:
- Static components (like PageTitle) pass with minimal test setup
- Dynamic components (with router, fetch, context dependencies) fail in CI
- There's no consistent pattern for handling data dependencies in tests
- Working test example: `npm run test:ci -- --testMatch="**/components/PageTitle/*.test.js"`

## Requirements
1. Create a standardized testing infrastructure for all component types:
   - Static components (no external dependencies)
   - Data-dependent components (props-based)
   - Dynamic components (fetch, router, context-based)

2. All tests should pass consistently in:
   - Local development environment
   - CI environment (GitHub Actions)

3. The solution should be:
   - Reusable across all components
   - Easy to implement for new components
   - Well-documented for developer adoption

## Technical Notes
The implementation will include:

1. **Test Utilities**:
   - Router mock that supports i18n/locale
   - Fetch API mock for data fetching
   - Context provider wrappers if needed

2. **Test Templates**:
   - Basic template for static components
   - Extended template for data-dependent components
   - Full template for dynamic components

3. **Configuration Updates**:
   - Jest configuration optimized for CI
   - Setup files for common mocks
   - Documentation of patterns and usage

Current CI setup:
```yaml
- name: Test
  working-directory: ./frontend
  run: npm run test:ci
```

## Approach to Implementation
We'll take an incremental approach:

1. **Phase 1: Foundation (This Issue)**
   - Create test utilities and basic configurations
   - Verify with static components
   - Document the approach

2. **Phase 2: Enhancement (Future Issue)**
   - Extend to data-dependent components
   - Add specialized mocks as needed
   - Update documentation

3. **Phase 3: Complete Coverage (Future Issue)**
   - Support for complex components
   - Integration tests for main user flows
   - Performance optimization for CI

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create test utilities in `utils/testUtils.js` with router and fetch mocks
- [ ] Create test setup file `jest.setup.js` with required configuration
- [ ] Update Jest configuration to optimize for CI environment
- [ ] Create standardized test templates for three component types
- [ ] Successfully test a static component using the new infrastructure
- [ ] Successfully test a data-dependent component using the new infrastructure
- [ ] Successfully test a dynamic component using the new infrastructure
- [ ] Document the approach and patterns in README.md
- [ ] All tests pass in CI environment
