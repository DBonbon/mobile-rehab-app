## Updates
### Full CI/CD Implementation Guide

Based on your existing CI workflows, I've created a complete CI/CD pipeline. Here's how everything works together:

#### Overview of the CI/CD Pipeline
- [ ] **Testing Phase**: Your existing CI workflows, now enhanced with linting and additional checks
- [ ] **Build Phase**: Added to the CI workflows, packages both frontend and backend for deployment  
- [ ] **Deployment Phase**: New CD workflow that deploys the application to your servers
- [ ] **Rollback Capability**: Script to revert to previous deployments if needed

#### Key Components
- [ ] **CI Workflows**:
  - Frontend testing, linting, and packaging
  - Backend testing, linting, and packaging
- [ ] **CD Workflow**:
  - Triggered automatically after CI workflows complete successfully
  - Only runs for pushes to main branch
  - Packages the application for deployment
  - Securely deploys to your server using SSH
- [ ] **Deployment Scripts**:
  - Main deployment script that handles installation and service restarts
  - Environment configuration for different deployment environments
  - Rollback script for handling deployment failures
- [ ] **Security**:
  - Uses GitHub Secrets for secure credential storage
  - Dedicated SSH key for deployments
  - Preserves environment variables during deployment

#### Implementation Notes
* **Database Migrations**: The deploy script runs migrations automatically, but you might want to add a manual approval step for major schema changes
* **Media Files**: Media uploads are preserved during deployments
* **Permissions**: The deploy script updates file permissions, but you might need to adjust based on your specific requirements
* **Linting**: Not fixing all lint comments - focusing only on critical ones for now

#### Next Steps
The implementation will follow the steps outlined in the original issue, with priority on getting the testing phase working first.
